                <p>The Privacy Policy was last updated on August 28, 2018. CloudCite and its developers may without notice to you and at its sole discretion, amend this policy.

                <h6>CloudCite takes privacy very seriously. Here are some of the steps we take to protect your privacy:</h6>
                <ol>
                    <li>We use <a href="https://www.websecurity.symantec.com/security-topics/what-is-ssl-tls-https" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a> to safeguard your information from being modified while being transferred to and from our APIs, servers, and/or databases.</li>
                    <li>We use an HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policy which forces all server, API, and database requests and responses to pass through encrypted Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) connections instead of plain text HTTP.</li>
                    <li>We use Auth0 token-based authentication so you can rest assured your password and personal information is protected</li>
                    <li>We do not use popup ads or force you to click on ads</li>
                    <li>Only Hackdromeda team members can access the CloudCite database. Project contributors cannot see your data.</li>
                </ol>

                    <li>Use our own tracking tools and analytics to improve the service and record session information</li>
                    <li>Get basic session information for CloudFlare DDoS protection</li>
